## Project Overview

The Food Delivery Application is a full-stack web application designed to connect customers with restaurants, enabling food ordering, delivery management, and restaurant discovery. It supports multiple user roles (Customer, Restaurant Owner, Delivery Person, Admin) and includes advanced features like dynamic delivery fee calculation based on geographic coordinates, image uploads to AWS S3, and email notifications for order and delivery updates.

This project demonstrates proficiency in **Spring Boot**, **RESTful APIs**, **JPA/Hibernate**, **Spring Security**, and integration with third-party services like AWS S3 and Google Maps API. The codebase is modular, maintainable, and follows best practices for scalability and security.

## Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture** to ensure modularity and maintainability:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses, with role-based access control using Spring Security.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, including cart management, order processing, delivery fee calculation, and notification services.
- **Repository Layer**: Interacts with the PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA.
- **Model Layer**: Defines entities like `User`, `Restaurant`, `FoodItem`, `Order`, `Delivery`, and `CartItem`, with appropriate JPA annotations.
- **Configuration**: Uses `application.properties` for environment-specific settings, including database, AWS S3, Google Maps API, and email configurations.

The application integrates with **AWS S3** for image storage and **Google Maps API** for distance-based delivery fee calculations. It uses **Spring Security** for JWT authentication and role-based authorization.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** (JDK)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **PostgreSQL** (version 12 or higher)
- **AWS S3 Account** (with access key and secret key)
- **Google Maps API Key** (with Distance Matrix API enabled)
- **Gmail Account** (for email notifications)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd FoodDelivery
   ```

2. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   - Create a database named `food_delivery`.
   - Update `application.properties` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/food_delivery
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

3. **Configure AWS S3**:
   - Update `application.properties` with your AWS credentials and bucket name:
     ```properties
     aws.accessKeyId=your_access_key
     aws.secretKey=your_secret_key
     aws.region=your_region
     aws.s3.bucketName=your_bucket_name
     ```

4. **Configure Google Maps API**:
   - Obtain a Google Maps API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Add the key to `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     google.maps.api.key=your_google_maps_api_key
     ```

5. **Configure Email Notifications**:
   - Update `application.properties` with your Gmail credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.mail.username=your_email@gmail.com
     spring.mail.password=your_app_specific_password
     ```

6. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

7. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

8. **Database Initialization**:
   - The application uses `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` to automatically create/update database tables based on entity definitions.
